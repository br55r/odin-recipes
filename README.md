Odin is a foundation course which has taught me multiple stuff.

My terminal knowledge is better than ever thanks to Odin.

Not to mention all the resources they have linked and the information that came with it is now embedded in my brain.

The foundation is currently teaching me basics of HTML, which I am loving so far.

The project you currently see is a basic recipes website which I built with HTML.

I had WAY too much fun making it and learned a lot of fundamentals along the way.
